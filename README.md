### 🧠 About Me

- 🐍 Python is the first programming language that comes to mind when i think i have to build a new project that solves some **computer-science-solvable** problem of mine.  
- 💜 Cant stop loving **Sublime Text** no matter how beautiful others build their interfaces for me. Guess I'm old-school.  
- 🤖 Fascinated by the possibilities of **Deep Learning**.  
	- 🎯 As a challenge that started this 2025 New Year - completed 10 projects in **Supervised Learning**, 10 projects in **Unsupervised Learning**. Now on my 5th project in **Re-inforcement Learning**.  
	- ⚙️ Absolutely intrigued by the possible daily routine tasks that can be solved and automated **if I get to** train and build an ML model with Re-inforcement Learning.  
- 💬 As part of the shouldn't get behind the current youngster-trend of **vibe-coding**. On projects where time is a concern I make **ChatGPT** or **Claude** write the backend python REST API's for me. And make **Lovable** build my desired **color-palette** version of front-end NextJS for me. And then I just link the backend and frontend together and it just works like magic 24/7. I'm starting to love the places Computer Science is taking me these days.  
- 🌱 Always learning 24/7 — from clean code to creative thinking.
